# Data Analytics and Visualization in Python

This repository contains Python programs for Data Analytics and Visulaisation Practicals. The code is minimalized and commented throughly to enhance readablity.

NOTE: To run some of the notebooks you will need to install the required libraries. This can be done in the following ways:
- If you are using Annaconda, open Annaconda Prompt and use `conda install <packagename>`.
- If you are using your global Python environment simply install the packages using the `pip install <packagename>` command.
- Packages can be directly installed from the notebook, by adding a cell and typing `!pip install <packagename>`.
